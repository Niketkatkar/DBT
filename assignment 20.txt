1.Which of these views are updateable (will allow DML operations)? 


Create View DAILYORDERS as Select Distinct Cnum, Snum, Onum, Odate from ORDERS; 	
-> yes


Create View Custotals as Select cname, Sum (amt) Sum_Amt from Orders, Customers 	where Orders.cnum=Customers.cnum 		Group by cname;
-> No


Create view Thirdorders as Select * from Dailyorders 	where odate=’1990-10-03’; 	
-> No

Create view Nullcities as Select snum, sname, city from Salespeople 	where city is NULL 		OR sname BETWEEN 'A' and 'MZ'; 
->yes


2. Create a view of the Salespeople table called Commissions. This view will include only the snum and comm fields. Through this view, someone could enter or change commissions, but only to values between .10 and .20. 
->

Create view COMMISSIONS as 
select Snum, Comm from SALESPEOPLE 
	where Comm between 0.10 and 0.20 	with check option;


 3.Some SQL implementations have a built-in constant representing the current date, sometimes called “CURDATE” or “SYSDATE”. The word SYSDATE can therefore be used in a SQL statement, and be replaced by the current date when the value is accessed by commands such as Select or Insert. We will use a view of the Orders table called Entryorders to insert rows into the Orders table. Create the Orders table, so that SYSDATE is automatically inserted for odate if no value is given. Then create the Entryorders view so that no values can be given. 
->

 create table ORDERS_DEMO03 
( 	Onum int(5), 
Amt float(5,2), 
Odate date default (SYSDATE()) ); 

insert into ORDERS_DEMO03 (Onum, Amt)
 	values (01, 2);

 select * from ORDERS_DEMO03; 

create view ENTRYORDERS as 
select * from ORDERS_DEMO03 	
where Onum not in (select Onum_Temp from 		(select Onum "Onum_Temp" from ORDERS_DEMO03) as TEMP) 		with check option; 

drop view ENTRYORDERS; 

create view ENTRYORDERS as 
select * from ORDERS_DEMO03 	
where Onum in 	(select Onum_Temp from 	
	(select Onum Onum_Temp from ORDERS_DEMO03) as TEMP) 			with check option; 
alter table ORDERS_DEMO03 add PRIMARY KEY (Onum);
